As a web developer, the three main languages we use to build websites are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We use HTML to structure the site, CSS to design and layout the web page, and JavaScript to create dynamically updating content. For this week, I have build a simple website about Kateda Membership Club using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Please do a research which domain site do you prefer to purchase based on the price and needs. (I choose domain from Niagahoster because it's cheap and convincing)

2. Login > Register > Choose "Search New Domain / Cari Domain Baru".

## Setting Up DNS and Connect Domain to Netlify ![Setting_DNS](images/Setting_DNS.png)
The Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device.

1. Go to your Netlify account, choose your deploy site.
   
   ![Choose Site Deploy](images/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_1_New.png)

2. Click Menu "Domain Management" to "Add a Domain" and verify your domain from Niagahoster to Netlify's deploy site. 
   
   ![Add Domain](images/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_2_New1.png)

   ![Verify Domain](images/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_2_New2.png)
   
3. After verify domain, then click "Awaiting External DNS" and "Set Up Netlify DNS for your domain" plus "Verify" it, as follows.

   ![Set Up Netlify DNS](images/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_5_New.png)

   ![Verify Domain to Netlify](images/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_6_New.png)

4. Next step are Updating your domain's nameserver from Netlify to Niagahoster as follows on the screenshots below.

   ![Add Domain to Netlify](images/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_7_New.png) 

   ![Add DNS Records](images/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_8_New.png)

   ![Nameservers Changed](images/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_13_New.png) 

5. Go back to your Netlify account and verify DNS configuration, then wait for external DNS propagation. Probably 1 to 2 hours or max. 24 hours until your domain's link will be ready to publish.
